Improved decision-making



9. Key Learnings

What worked

What to avoid

Enterprise GenAI best practices




Tone:

Professional

Confident

Senior-architect level

No marketing fluff



---

Part 2: Executive Deck (12–15 Slides)

Create a CIO / CISO / CTO-ready PowerPoint outline with slide titles and bullet points.

Include:

1. Title Slide


2. Problem Statement

still gettign this eeror 
I can see you're still getting the SSL error. Looking at your Cloudflare DNS screenshot, I can see the issue - the "portfolio" CNAME record is still set to "Proxied" (orange cloud).

You need to change it to "DNS only" to fix the SSL error. Let me guide you through this:

Fix the SSL Error in Cloudflare
Steps:

In your Cloudflare DNS Records (the second screenshot you shared)
Find the row with:
Type: CNAME
Name: portfolio
Content: appliedailearner.github.io
Proxy status: 🟠 Proxied (orange cloud)
Click the orange cloud icon in the "Proxy status" column
It will change to a gray cloud and show "DNS only"
The row should now show: ⚪ DNS only (gray cloud)
Click Save or it may auto-save
Why This Fixes It
Proxied (🟠): Cloudflare intercepts the SSL certificate, causing a mismatch with GitHub Pages' certificate → SSL ERROR
DNS only (⚪): Traffic goes directly to GitHub Pages with its valid SSL certificate → NO ERROR
