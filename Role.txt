**Role:**
Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer and Full Stack Developer specialized in Enterprise Portfolios.

**Context:**
I currently have a static HTML/CSS portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages. It functions, but the design feels dated, the metrics are not framed for a leadership role, and the UX for case studies is poor (linking to raw files).

**Objective:**
Refactor my existing portfolio code to create a high-converting, "Executive Level" personal website. The goal is to impress Recruiters and CTOs looking for an Azure Solutions Architect & Strategic Leader.

**Key Constraints & Requirements:**
1.  **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid), and minimal Vanilla JavaScript. No heavy frameworks (React/Vue) unless necessary for animations.
2.  **Design System:** Clean, "Enterprise Tech" aesthetic (Microsoft Azure blue tones, dark greys, plenty of whitespace). Font: 'Inter' or 'Roboto'.

**Specific Section Instructions:**

### 1. Global Navigation & Header
* **Sticky Nav:** Make the navigation bar sticky at the top with a subtle blur effect background.
* **CTA:** Add a prominent "Download Resume" or "Book Consultation" button in the top right.
* **Branding:** Update the logo text area to look professional. Ensure the code is ready for a custom domain (CNAME preparation).

### 2. Hero Section (The "Hook")
* **Headline Rewrite:** Change the current specific dollar amount ($55k) to a percentage or broader impact statement.
    * *Current:* "$55K+ Annual Cost Optimization"
    * *Change to:* "Delivering 30%+ Cloud Cost Reduction & Enterprise Architecture Modernization."
* **Visuals:** Use a modern CSS abstract background or a clean, professional headshot container with a subtle drop shadow.

### 3. "Strategic Leadership" & About Section
* **Visual Hierarchy:** The current text is too dense. Convert the "Core Competencies" into a 3-column Grid Card layout.
* **Icons:** Add relevant SVG icons (e.g., Cloud, Shield, Server, People) to each card to break up the text.
* **Typography:** Increase line height to 1.6 for better readability.

### 4. Projects / Case Studies (Critical UX Fix)
* **Architecture Change:** Do NOT link directly to PDF/PPT files.
* **New Template:** Create a generic `project-details.html` template.
* **Card Design:** On the homepage, display projects as cards with:
    * Project Title
    * 3-4 "Tech Stack" tags (e.g., #Azure, #Terraform, #Security).
    * A "Read Case Study" button.
* **The Modal/Page:** When clicked, it should open a dedicated view (or modal) that follows the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and allows me to embed the Presentation Slides using an iframe or image carousel.

### 5. Contact Section
* **Form UX:** Refine the contact form styling. Make input fields large and touch-friendly.
* **Backend:** configure the form action to use 'Formspree' or 'Netlify Forms' so submissions actually work via email.
* **Footer:** specific links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Certifications (Credly).

**Deliverables:**
Please provide the updated `index.html`, a modern `style.css`, and the code for the new `project-template.html`.
