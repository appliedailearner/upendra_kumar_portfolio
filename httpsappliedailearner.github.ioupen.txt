when i click on Rad Case Study Under Strategic Data center Migration section it reaches to a page which looks incomplete and bad.
When I click on View Deck  Under Strategic Data center Migration section  it gets me very flat page with average llloking text ,style . this deck is not suitable for seneior leadership view.


verify all such sections under each project and make sure the desinataion page has valuable related content which is aligned with style,typogrpahy,look and feel of main page 

i found discerpencies in terms of what content was getting displayed when website was running on local host vs live on GitHub pages . find all subsc diceprencies . do a complete audit and make live website appear as it was appearing duding local hosting
