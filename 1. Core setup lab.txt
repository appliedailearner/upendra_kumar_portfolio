1. Core setup lab
Use: Set up Universal Print on Microsoft Learn: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/universal-print/set-up-universal-print​

This walks you through: turning on the service in your tenant, installing the Universal Print connector, registering a printer, sharing it, and then printing from a client device.​

2. Access and licensing prep
Before the lab, check Get access to Universal Print to be sure your Microsoft 365 tenant and licenses support it: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/universal-print/get-access-to-universal-print​

This page explains which SKUs (like Microsoft 365 A3/A5, etc.) include Universal Print and how print jobs are pooled per tenant.​

3. Deeper / optional labs
For a more detailed, step‑by‑step blog‑style lab (screenshots, narrative), use “Step-by-Step: Configure and manage Microsoft Universal Print”: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/.../step-by-step-configure-and-manage-microsoft-universal-print/2227224​

If you want to extend Universal Print with code later, the GitHub universalprint-samples repo has Graph/API samples you can treat like advanced labs: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/universalprint-samples​
