A professional 3D isometric infographic showing a strategic cloud migration journey. On the left, a dark, cluttered legacy data center with tangled cables. A glowing blue bridge (Azure Migrate) connects it to a bright, futuristic cloud city on the right. Floating holographic icons represent 'Discovery', 'Assessment', and 'Migration'. The final destination is a sleek glass building with a floating '30% TCO Reduction' badge. Microsoft Azure aesthetic, clean lines, soft cinematic lighting, 8k, high-tech corporate style.
