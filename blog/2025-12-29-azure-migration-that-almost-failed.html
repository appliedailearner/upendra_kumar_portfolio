        <p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: 600;">
            A real-world Azure migration story showing how DRIs, RFCs, and guardrails transformed a stalled landing zone
            program into a scalable execution model.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 1: The Illusion of Progress</span></h2>
        <p>
            It started like most enterprise cloud initiatives: high energy, a mandate from the CIO, and two senior
            engineers—myself and a lead from the partner SI—staring at a whiteboard. We had the "perfect" plan. We had
            the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) diagrams printed out. We had a backlog of 400 VMs to move.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first three months, we felt productive. We deployed a Hub-and-Spoke network. We built a few
            management groups. We even migrated a couple of low-risk dev workloads. The status reports were green.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we were building a facade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Underneath the Terraform scripts and the weekly standups, we didn't have an operating model. We had two
            people making every single decision in a vacuum. We were the bottleneck, the escalation point, and the
            execution team all at once. We just didn't know it yet.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 2: The Silent Killer (Missing Decision Mechanics)</span></h2>
        <p>
            The cracks appeared when we tried to scale. The application teams started asking questions we hadn't
            anticipated:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"How do we handle private endpoint DNS resolution for our PaaS services?"</li>
            <li>"Who approves the firewall rules for the new subnet?"</li>
            <li>"Why can't we use the standard marketplace image for our legacy app?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Every question triggered a meeting. Every meeting triggered an email chain. Every email chain waited for me
            or the other lead to say "yes" or "no."
        </p>
        <p>
            We weren't doing architecture anymore; we were doing traffic control for a traffic jam we had created. The
            problem wasn't technical. The problem was that we lacked a <strong>decision mechanic</strong>. We treated
            architecture as a static deliverable, not a dynamic process of trade-offs.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 3: The Cutover That Wasn't</span></h2>
        <p>
            The breaking point came on a Tuesday night. We were scheduled to cut over a critical financial reporting
            application. The "Migration Factory" (a team of 5 contractors) had moved the bits. The database was syncing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 2:00 AM, we called a rollback.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application couldn't talk to the on-prem mainframe. Why? Because the route table (UDR) on the spoke
            subnet was missing a specific next-hop to the NVA, and the firewall rules hadn't been propagated to the
            secondary region's policy. Worse, the application relied on a hardcoded IP that changed during the move, and
            we had no internal DNS resolution for the new private endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a humiliating failure. It wasn't a "glitch." It was a systemic failure of our landing zone to support
            the actual workload requirements.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 4: Introducing DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals)</span></h2>
        <p>
            We paused the migration for two weeks. I knew we couldn't just "try harder." We needed to change how we
            worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step was establishing <strong>DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We stopped being the "Cloud Team" and started breaking down ownership.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity DRI:</strong> Owned Entra ID, RBAC, and PIM.</li>
            <li><strong>Network DRI:</strong> Owned the Hub, Firewalls, ExpressRoute, and DNS.</li>
            <li><strong>Security DRI:</strong> Owned Azure Policy and Defender for Cloud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I moved from being the person <em>doing</em> everything to the person <em>orchestrating</em> the DRIs. If a
            firewall port needed opening, the Network DRI owned the decision, the implementation, and the risk.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 5: The RFC Revolution</span></h2>
        <p>
            Next, we killed the "meeting to decide" culture. We implemented a strict <strong>Request for Comments
                (RFC)</strong> process.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wanted to deviate from the standard pattern—say, use a Public IP instead of a Private Endpoint—you
            didn't schedule a meeting. You wrote a 2-page Markdown document:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> What are you trying to do?</li>
            <li><strong>Options:</strong> What are the alternatives (A, B, C)?</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Why is B the right choice?</li>
            <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> What risks are we accepting?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We reviewed these asynchronously. Decisions were logged. We stopped re-litigating the same arguments every
            week. The velocity of decision-making tripled because we forced clarity before conversation.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 6: Guardrails as Enablers</span></h2>
        <p>
            With ownership and decisions fixed, we tackled the fear of breaking things. We shifted from "gatekeeping" to
            "guardrails."
        </p>
        <p>
            We implemented <strong>Azure Policy</strong> in "Deny" mode for the non-negotiables:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No Public IPs on NICs.</li>
            <li>No unencrypted storage accounts.</li>
            <li>Allowed regions only (East US 2 / Central US).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For everything else, we used "Audit." This gave the migration factory confidence. They knew that if the
            deployment succeeded, it was compliant. They didn't need to ask for permission; the platform gave them
            permission by not failing.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 7: The Portfolio Assessment Backbone</span></h2>
        <p>
            We revisited our backlog. The initial "list of VMs" was useless. We needed a <strong>Portfolio
                Assessment</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We enriched our inventory with metadata that actually mattered for migration:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dependency Map:</strong> What talks to what? (We used Azure Migrate dependency visualization).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Criticality:</strong> Is this a Tier 1 app or a Tier 3 tool?</li>
            <li><strong>Data Classification:</strong> PII/PCI?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This allowed us to group applications into "Move Groups" based on affinity, not just alphabet. We stopped
            trying to move "servers" and started moving "capabilities."
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 8: Right-Sizing and the Business Case</span></h2>
        <p>
            We also got serious about money. The "lift and shift" was projected to increase costs by 20%.
        </p>
        <p>
            We implemented an aggressive <strong>Right-Sizing</strong> framework. We didn't just look at allocated CPU;
            we looked at <em>consumed</em> CPU (95th percentile) over 30 days.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On-prem: 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM (Allocated)</li>
            <li>Usage: 5% avg, 15% peak</li>
            <li>Azure Target: Standard_D2s_v5 (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We combined this with Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) and 3-year Reserved Instances. Suddenly, the business case
            flipped from a 20% increase to a 15% savings. The CFO became our biggest advocate.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Act 9: From Heroics to Runbooks</span></h2>
        <p>
            Finally, we codified the execution. We banned "heroics."
        </p>
        <p>
            We built a <strong>Migration Runbook</strong> that was boringly detailed.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>T-minus 4 weeks: Enable replication.</li>
            <li>T-minus 1 week: Pre-cutover validation (DNS, Firewall).</li>
            <li>T-minus 2 hours: Stop app services.</li>
            <li>T-minus 0: Final sync and cutover.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We created checklists for everything. If it wasn't on the checklist, it didn't happen. The excitement of the
            migration night vanished. It became a boring, predictable series of checkboxes. And that is exactly what
            enterprise architecture should be.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="gradient-text">Lessons Learned</span></h2>
        <p>
            We didn't succeed because we wrote better Bicep code. We succeeded because we treated the migration as a
            <strong>product</strong>, not a project.
