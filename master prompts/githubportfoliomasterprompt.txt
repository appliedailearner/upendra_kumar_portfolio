**Role:** Act as a Senior Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer.

**Objective:** Convert my resume content (provided below) into a fully functional, responsive, multi-page personal portfolio website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

**Project Requirements:**

1.  **Folder Structure:**
    * Define a clean, industry-standard directory structure (e.g., `root`, `assets/css`, `assets/js`, `assets/images`, `pages/`).
    * Provide the exact filename and path for every code block you generate.

2.  **Pages to Create:**
    * **Home (`index.html`):** A modern Hero section with a clear headline, a brief bio, and a Call-to-Action (CTA) button to "Download Resume" (linking to a placeholder `resume.pdf`).
    * **About:** A dedicated section or page detailing my professional summary and background.
    * **Skills:** A visually distinct section (e.g., pills, progress bars, or grid cards) categorized by technical and soft skills.
    * **Projects:** A showcase of projects extracted from the resume, including titles, descriptions, and tech stacks used.
    * **Contact:** A professional layout with a contact form skeleton and social media links.

3.  **Key Features (Based on Video Best Practices):**
    * **Theme Switcher:** Implement a working **Light/Dark mode toggle** button. Default to Dark mode (as it looks more "trending").
    * **Responsiveness:** The site must be mobile-friendly using modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid).
    * **SEO:** Ensure the HTML is semantic and includes basic meta tags for SEO optimization.
    * **Privacy:** If specific company names appear in the resume, replace them with generic titles (e.g., "Global Tech Firm", "FinTech Startup") to maintain anonymity.

**Design Style:** Use a "trending," clean, and high-end aesthetic. Focus on typography, whitespace, and subtle hover effects to make it look professional, not like a basic template.
